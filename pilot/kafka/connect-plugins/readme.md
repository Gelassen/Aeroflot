When using the Debezium PostgreSQL Connector with Kafka Connect, you typically need to pass the connector JAR (debezium-connector-postgres-2.5.3.jar) to Kafka Connect. However, you may also need to include additional dependencies required by the connector.

The Debezium documentation usually specifies any additional dependencies required by each connector version. Make sure to check the documentation for the version you're using. In some cases, the connector JAR itself may include all necessary dependencies, but in others, you may need to manually include them.

As of version 2.5.3, the Debezium PostgreSQL Connector may require additional dependencies such as the Kafka clients JAR (kafka-clients-x.y.z.jar). Again, it's always a good idea to consult the official documentation to ensure you have all the necessary dependencies for your specific use case.
